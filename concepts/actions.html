  <h1>Actions</h1>
  <p>
    Actions are responsible for server communicating and emitting the proper events to reducers to enable them to
    accurately keep track of the applications state.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you create a model in Lore, the framework automatically creates a set of actions for finding, creating,
    updating, deleting, and getting that resource. The blueprints have an implicit file structure that looks like
    this:
  </p>

{% highlight bash %}
|-src
  |-actions
    |-post
      |-create.js
      |-destroy.js
      |-find.js
      |-get.js
      |-update.js
  |-models
    |-post.js
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    All blueprints actions can be overridden by creating a file that matches the location of the blueprint. For
    example, if you wanted to override the <code>create</code> blueprint for a <code>post</code> model, you would
    create your own action at <code>actions/post/create.js</code>.
  </p>

{% highlight bash %}
|-src
  |-actions
    |-post
      |-create.js
  |-models
    |-post.js
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>There are two ways to override an action.</p>

  <h3>Override Option #1: Template</h3>
  <p>
    If your file contains an object, Lore will assume you just want to tailor (or tap into) the existing blueprint
    behavior, but you don't want to change the underlying implementation. This is useful if (for some reason) you
    wanted to turn off the default optimistic update behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach is also useful if you want to listen and log errors, or display them to the user using
    <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/snackbars-toasts.html">a snackbar or toast</a>. This
    can be achieved by defining a <code>beforeDispatch</code> function, example below.
  </p>
  <p>At the moment, the <code>beforeDispatch</code> property only exists on the error path.</p>

{% highlight js %}
module.exports = {

  // comments
  optimistic: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.ADD_POST,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.CREATING
  },

  // comments
  onSuccess: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.RESOLVED
  },

  // comments
  onError: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.REMOVE_POST,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING,
    beforeDispatch: function(response, args){
      console.log({
        message: "Post could not be created",
        response: response
      });
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>Override Option #2: Full Replacement</h3>

  <p>
    If your file contains a function, Lore will assume you want to replace the blueprint with your own implementation.
    While the need to do this should be rare, this would be necessary if (for example) you needed to make multiple
    API calls to complete an operation, or if the API was forcing business logic into the client (bad) and if a request
    failed you needed to make an API call to rollback changes or something. For well behaved/designed and
    convention-abiding APIs, the need to overwrite the default blueprint actions completely should be fairly uncommon.
  </p>

{% highlight js %}
module.exports = function create( params ) {
  return function( dispatch ) {
    var post = new Post(params);

    post.save().then(function() {
      dispatch({
        type: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
        payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.RESOLVED)
      });
    }).catch(function( response ) {
      var error = response.responseJSON;
      dispatch({
        type: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
        payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING, error)
      });
    });

    return dispatch({
      type: ActionTypes.ADD_POST,
      payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.CREATING)
    });
  };
};
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>Override Option #3: Redefine the Blueprints</h3>

  <p>
    While not an option at the moment, Lore will be providing the ability to define your own blueprints, in case you
    want (or need) to overwrite the default behavior across all models.
  </p>
