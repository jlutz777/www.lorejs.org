  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    While Lore's goal is to hide as much of the complexity and learning curve associated with building React
    applications as possible (at least initially), it's ability to do so becomes more difficult as your application
    becomes more complex and needs to be tailored to your specific situation.
  <p>
  </p>
    At some point, your application will no longer fit as neatly within the default conventions provided by the
    framework, and at that point you'll need to learn more about these concepts to help the framework adapt to your
    specific situation.
  <p>
  </p>
    The topics in this section make up the fundamental concepts and principles of Lore and React application development
    in general. Lore's goal is to put off requiring you to learn these concepts for as long as possible until the
    specific needs of your application require you to do so (gradual needs-based learning instead of forced upfront
    learning).
  <p>
  </p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Mastering these concepts and libraries will remove any trace of sense of "magic" that Lore
    provides, as Lore itself is really just a set of conventions and sensible defaults connecting the underlying
    libraries together.
