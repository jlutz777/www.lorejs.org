  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    While Lore's goal is to hide as much of the complexity and learning curve associated with building React
    applications as possible (at least initially), it's ability to do so becomes more difficult as your application
    becomes more complex and needs to be tailored to your specific situation.
  <p>
  </p>
    At some point, your application will no longer fit as neatly within the default conventions provided by the
    framework, and at that point you'll need to learn more about these concepts to help the framework adapt to your
    specific situation.
  <p>
  </p>
    The topics in this section make up the fundamental concepts and principles of Lore and React development in
    general. Lore's goal is to put off requiring you to learn them for as long as possible until the specific needs
    of your application require you to do so.
  <p>
  </p>
    Mastering these concepts will remove any trace of sense of "magic" that Lore provides, as Lore itself is really
    just a set of conventions and sensible defaults connecting the underlying libraries together.
  </p>

  <h3>What libraries is Lore built on?</h3>
  </p>
    Lore is built on a set of libraries that are very popular within the React community.
