  <h1>Routing</h1>
  <p>
    Lore uses <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-router">React-Router</a> for the routing tier. There isn't
    much the framework can do to make it easier to use (it's pretty straight forward) but this page will be filled
    with common examples overtime.
  </p>

  <h3>Modifying your Routes</h3>
  <p>
    All routes for Lore should be placed in the <code>routes.js</code> file at the root of your project.
  </p>

{% highlight jsx %}
import React from 'react';
import { Route, IndexRoute, Redirect } from 'react-router';

var Master = require('./src/components/Master');
var Home = require('./src/components/Home');

module.exports = (
  <Route>
    <Redirect from="/" to="/todos" query={{filter: 'all'}} />
    <Route path="/" component={Master}>
      <Route path="todos" component={Home} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
);
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>Using Routing</h3>
  <p>
    Will fill this out with examples overtime, but for now please see the
    <a href="/concepts/libraries/react-router/">section discussing react-router</a> for links to learning resources.
