  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    Because at some point docs are only so useful, and then you need to some codez.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lore has some examples <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples">in its source code</a>. If
    there is a specific example you'd like to see that doesn't exist, feel free to create an issue to suggest it.
