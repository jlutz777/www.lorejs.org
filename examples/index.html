  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    Because docs are only useful to a point, and then you need to some working code to better understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lore has some examples <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples">in its source code</a>. If
    there is a specific example you'd like to see that doesn't exist, feel free to
    <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/issues">create an issue to suggest it</a>.
