  <h1>Extending Lore</h1>
  <p>
    The majority of Lore is implemented as a collection of overridable hooks, similar to a plugin system. This allows
    you to change large chunks of it's behavior without needing to modify the library itself. Instead it can be
    modified on a per-project basis. You can do so either by defining hooks within your project itself (by placing
    your own hook definitions in a specific location) or by installing a hook through npm install and configure your
    <code>.lorerc</code> file to use that version of the hook instead.

      itself and also by downloading a package from npm and modifying the <code>.lorerc</code> file.
