  <h1>Architecture</h1>
  <p>
    Explanation of the underlying architecture of Lore. Intended to accelerate the learning curve for anyone who wants
    to help improve it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lore's architecture is built around a series of plugins, and these plugins are where its opinions and conventions
    are expressed.  As Lore's goal is to <em>respectfully</em> opinionated, each of these plugins can also be overriden
    with your own implementation if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lore is broken apart into 3 main pieces:
  </p>
  <h6><strong>/app</strong></h6>
  <p>This is where the Lore engine resides.  It's principle responsibilities are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Build the project-specific config</li>
    <li>To load and execute each of the plugins</li>
    <li>Render the application to the DOM</li>
  </ol>
  <h6><strong>/hooks</strong></h6>
  <p>
    Each folder under /hooks contains one of the hooks (plugins) that Lore uses to build it's behaviors.
  </p>
  <h6><strong>/loaders</strong></h6>

  <p>
    Anything that requires physically reading files goes into <code>/loaders</code>.  This is because the way files
    are loaded needed to be abstracted out to support testing.
  </p>
  <h4>Embedded Documentation</h4>
  <p>
    If you're looking for documentation on the specific code in Lore, most folders contain a README explaining the
    function of that folder, as do many files.  The intent was to create an experience where you could also learn about
    the architecture simply by navigating the code base, but in a more user-friendly fashion than just reading the code.
