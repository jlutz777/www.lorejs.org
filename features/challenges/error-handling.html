<div>
  <h1>Error Handling</h1>
  <p>
    Useful for informing the user when things don't go as planned and providing them with the ability to correct
    the error and try again.
  </p>

  <h3>Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    This video demonstrates what error handling looks like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em>
    prototype that <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> provides you when you sign up for an account.

  <h3>Architecture Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    The challenge when incorporating error handling into your applications architecture is making sure server errors
    are communicated back to components, so we can can inform the user when something bad happened and at least give
    them a chance to copy out their data or fix and retry the request.
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture Implementation</h3>
  <p>This video describes how Lore provides support for error handling.</p>
