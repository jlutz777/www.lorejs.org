<div>
  <h1>Optimistic Updates</h1>
  <p>
    Useful for providing the application with a feeling a snappy responsiveness by assuming server calls will
    be successful.
  </p>

  <h3>Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    This video demonstrates what optimistic updates looks like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em>
    prototype that <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> provides you when you sign up for an account.

  <h3>Architecture Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    The challenge with incorporating support for optimistic updates is making sure we can merge the optimistic data
    that we <em>assume</em> will be created successfully with the real data once it comes back from the server, and all
    while preventing duplicate data from appearing in the reducers.
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture Implementation</h3>
  <p>This video describes how Lore provides support for optimistic updates.</p>

  <h3><strong>TODO</strong>: Usage</h3>
  <p>
    Need to add example code showing how to visualize optimistic updates in a Lore application.
