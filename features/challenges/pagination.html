  <h1>Pagination (proposal)</h1>
  <p>
    Useful for moving through large datasets, and providing the user with a sliced view of the data.

      NOTE: This feature is still in the proposal stage, but the implementation approach Lore will likely follow is
      provided below.

  <h3>Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    This video demonstrates what pagination looks like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em> prototype
    that <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> provides you when you sign up for an account.

  <h3>Architecture Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    The core challenge here, similar to filtering, is preventing action/reducer explosion, but also being able to work
    <em>along side</em> filtering. Both of these involve slicing data up into pieces and you need both of them to work
    together and side-by-side.

  <h3>Architecture Implementation</h3>
  <p>This video describes how Lore will mostly likely implement pagination.</p>
