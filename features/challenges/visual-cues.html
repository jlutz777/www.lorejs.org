<div>
  <h1>Visual Cues</h1>
  <p>
    Useful for providing the user with a visual indication that some action is being performed but has no yet
    completed. Examples include fetching, updating and creating data. Doing this well enables your components to be
    completely data-driven.
  </p>

  <h3>Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    This video demonstrates what visual cues look like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em> prototype
    that <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> provides you when you sign up for an account.

  <h3>Architecture Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    The core challenge is making sure that any information that components need to know in order to render the correct
    view is contained within the data they're provided.
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture Implementation</h3>
  <p>This video describes how Lore implements support for visual cues.</p>

  <h3><strong>TODO</strong>: Usage</h3>
  <p>
    Need to add example code showing how to display visual cues in a Lore application.
