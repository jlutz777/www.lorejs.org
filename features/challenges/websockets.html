<div>
  <h1>WebSockets (real-time)</h1>
  <p>
    Provides the ability for an application's data to update without requiring the user to refresh the page. Especially
    useful in applications where multiple people view and interact with the same data, especially when data changes
    at a high frequency.
  </p>

  <h3>Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    This video demonstrates what real-time functionality looks like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em>
    prototype that <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> provides you when you sign up for an account.

  <h3>Architecture Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    The challenge with adding support for WebSockets is finding a way to integrate it into the existing infrastructure
    that supports REST API interactions <em>without</em> having to duplicate actions or reducers for every real-time
    endpoint (which would be tedious and error prone).
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture Implementation</h3>
  <p>This video describes how Lore will most likely implement support for WebSockets</p>

  <h3><strong>TODO</strong>: Usage</h3>
  <p>
    Need to add example code showing how to integrate support for WebSockets in a Lore application.
