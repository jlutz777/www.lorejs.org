<h1>Build System</h1>
<p>
  This section documents the parts of Lore that are directly relevant to Webpack. For now that means the development
  server and the Webpack configuration.
</p>

<p>
  The video below is an excerpt from the full <a href="/getting-started/introduction-to-lore/">Introduction to Lore</a>
  video and provides a summary of how Lore helps with Webpack.

<h2>Relevant Files</h2>
<p>
  The files below are worth calling out as especially relevant to Webpack in terms of the development server and
  modifying the Webpack configuration.
</p>

<h3>server.js</h3>

<p>
  This is the development webpack server.  It is required if you want to support the awesomeness
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/100010922">that is hot reloading</a>. This is the file that gets executed when you run
  `npm start`. By default it will make your project available on port 3000. In production, this file is never
  executed. Instead, the `index.html` file is served up, and the browser looks for `/dist/bundle.js` (which webpack
  will have built when the project when the project was deployed).
</p>

<h3>webpack/config.js</h3>

<p>
  This is the common webpack config, which can be overridden on a per-environment basis by adding settings to one of the
  config files in <code>webpack/env/</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    In the future this section will also include a breakdown of what all the Webpack config settings means and what
    defaults Lore comes with.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>webpack/env/</h3>

<p>
  This directory is where you can place custom webpack configs that should be used when building for a specific
  environment such as development, production or staging. Feel free to delete these files or add more. The name of
  the file used matches whatever your current <code>NODE_ENV</code>is set to
</p>

<p>
  So if your current node environment is <code>NODE_ENV=production</code> the final Webpack config will be
  <code>webpack/config.js</code> overidden by any settings in <code>webpack/env/production.js</code>.
</p>
