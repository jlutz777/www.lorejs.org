  <h3>Generators</h3>
  <p>
    The CLI can also generate project files such as components, actions and reducers. Files can be generated in ES5,
    ES6 or ESNext syntax (if you want to use decorators and static property types).

  <p>
    <strong>Todo: add examples for all generators</strong>
  </p>
