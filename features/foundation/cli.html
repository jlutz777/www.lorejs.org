  <h1>CLI</h1>
  <p>
    The CLI for Lore is intended to be a complimentary utiltiy to the framework itself. It has the ability to generate
    common files (like components, actions, reducers), as well as flags for generating those files in ES5 or ES6
    style syntax. The generators can be especially useful when you need to override a default action or reducer.
  <p>
  </p>
    As the CLI evolves, it will include the ability to write your own plugins for it, so you can extend it to suit the
    specific needs of your project. To learn more about the CLI and adding your own generators check out the CLI Docs.

  <h3>Generators</h3>
  <p>
    The CLI can also generate project files such as components, actions and reducers. Files can be generated in ES5,
    ES6 or ESNext syntax (if you want to use decorators and static property types).
