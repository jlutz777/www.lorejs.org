<h1>new</h1>
<p>
  CLI command to create a new project.
<p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

{% highlight bash %}
lore new [app-name]
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
  Let's say you want to create a project called <code>my-awesome-app</code>. To do that, you would run this command:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
lore new my-awesome-app
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Next you need to install the project dependencies and start the server.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
npm install
npm start
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Once the project finishes building, you can visit the application at <code>localhost:3000</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Note that <code>npm start</code> is really just an alias for <code>node server</code>, so you also run this:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
npm install
node server
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Changing the Port</h3>
<p>
  By default the project is served from localhost:3000, but if you want to use a different port you can
  change it by passing the port in as an argument to the <code>node server</code> version of the startup command
  (this won't work with <code>npm start</code>):
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
node server --port=3001
{% endhighlight %}
