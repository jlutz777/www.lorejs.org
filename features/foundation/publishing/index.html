<h1>Publishing</h1>
<p>
  Lore provides built-in support for publishing your project to two popular platforms; Surge and GitHub Pages.
</p>

<p>
  The video below is an excerpt from the full <a href="/getting-started/introduction-to-lore/">Introduction to Lore</a>
  video and provides a summary of how Lore helps.

<h3>Feature Comparison</h3>
<p>
  The video below provides a feature comparison of both platforms in order to help you choose between them. Surge
  basically includes everything GitHub Pages offers and more (for a small fee) and is also generally easier to
  publish to. The advantage of GitHub pages is that it provides a way to view and edit your code without having
  to download the files and republish.
