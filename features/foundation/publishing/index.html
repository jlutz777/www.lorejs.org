  <h3>Feature Comparison</h3>
  <p>
    The video below provides a feature comparison of both platforms in order to help you choose between them. Surge
    basically includes everything GitHub Pages offers and more (for a small fee) and is also generally easier to
    publish to. The advantage of GitHub pages is that it provides a way to view and edit your code without having
    to download the files and republish.
