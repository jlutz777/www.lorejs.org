  <h1>Publishing to Surge</h1>
  <p>
    Instructions for publishing to [Surge](https://surge.sh).
  <p>

  <h3>Video Demonstration</h3>
  <p>
    This will be added in the future.
  <p>

  <h3>Install the Gulp Task</h3>
  <p>
    To publish your project to GitHub Pages first install the gulp task to do so:
  <p>

{% highlight bash %}
lore generate surge
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    This task will automatically install any dependencies and add them to the <code>devDependencies</code> in your
    <code>package.json</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Publish Your Project</h3>
  <p>Next you'll need to run the gulp task to publish your project:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
gulp surge
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    This task will build your project for production and push your code to Surge. If you don't pass in a domain,
    Surge will generate a random one for you and you'll need to confirm it during the build. If you already have a
    domain in mind you want to use, you can pass that to the task and it will use it instead:
  </p>

{% highlight bash %}
gulp surge --domain=my-app.surge.sh
{% endhighlight %}

</div>
