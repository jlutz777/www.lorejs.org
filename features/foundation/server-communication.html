<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>
  If you'd like to know more about the blueprints Lore uses to build the convention-supplied actions, see the
  <a href="/concepts/actions/">docs on actions</a>. If you'd like to know more about how the AJAX abstraction tier Lore
  uses is built (what the blueprints are built on) see the <a href="/features/challenges/ajax-abstraction/">docs on AJAX Abstraction</a>.

  If none of those docs are sufficient to answer your question, please <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/issues">file an issue</a>
  and we'll answer your question and use it to better expand the documentation for others.
