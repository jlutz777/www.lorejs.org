  <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>
  <p>
    The value proposition Lore provides varies a bit based on your comfort and experience building React applications.
    <strong>If you're just started out with React</strong>, or Web Development in general, you'll probably care more
    about how Lore makes it easier to learn React and build your first web application. <strong>If you've been developing
    for a while</strong>, and have worked on large single page applications before, you'll likely care more about what
    Lore includes to make it easier grow and support your application as it evolves over time.
