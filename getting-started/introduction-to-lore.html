  <h1>Introduction to Lore / How Lore makes it easier to get started</h1>
  <p>
    Lore's goal is to simplify the "getting started" journey with React, and to create an experience where you can
    start building serious applications without knowing anything more than React itself.

    To do that, the framework bundles the libraries mentioned in the video above and configures them with sensible
    defaults. It also significantly simplifies what is one of the most time consuming parts of React development;
    writing code to communicate with API servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand <em>how</em> Lore makes it easier to get started with React, the project structure, and the design
    philosophy behind the framework, please see this video.
