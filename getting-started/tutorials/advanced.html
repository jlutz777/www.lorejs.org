<h1>Lore Tutorial: Advanced</h1>
<p>
  Sadly, there is no tutorial yet for advanced developers, which (for the sake of providing a definition) means
  <strong>you have a built and supported a large client-facing React application</strong>, ideally through at least
  one major version change of the API.
</p>

<p>
  This page will instead convey what the tutorial <strong>will</strong> include once it exists. If you'd like to be
  part of the conversation and influence what will be in this tutorial, there
  <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/issues/103">there has been an issue created</a> expressly for that purpose.
  Love to hear your thoughts!
</p>

<h3>The Application</h3>
<p>
  TBD
</p>

<h3>Concepts to be Covered</h3>

  <li>Authorization (user permissions)</li>
  <li>Interacting with multiple APIs</li>
  <li>Protecting your app from breaking API changes</li>
  <li>WebSockets integration (for real-time support)</li>
