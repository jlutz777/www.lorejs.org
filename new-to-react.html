  <h1>Introduction / React & Lore</h1>
  <p>
    Lore's goal is to provide a framework that makes it easy to build React applications. If you're new to React
    development, this section describes what it's like to build your first React application, and lays the foundation
    for the value proposition Lore provides to new React developers.
  </p>

  <h3>Building your first React app</h3>
  <p>
    React is pretty awesome, and the ecosystem has a lot of phenomenal libraries, but at the moment itâ€™s really up to
    you to figure out how to piece them together into a functional application with a good client side architecture.
    The challenge with this situation is that it creates an uphill climb you need to push through before you can
    really start to feel capable of expressing your ideas as code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The video below walks through one variant of that experience, and is intended to provide a foundation for one of
    the problems Lore is trying to help address, which is reducing the learning curve required to build large React
    applications.

  <h3>How Lore makes it easier to get started</h3>
  <p>
    Lore's goal is to simplify the "getting started" journey with React, and to create an experience where you can
    start building serious applications without knowing anything more than React itself.

    To do that, the framework bundles the libraries mentioned in the video above and configures them with sensible
    defaults. It also significantly simplifies what is one of the most time consuming parts of React development;
    writing code to communicate with API servers.
  </p>

    To understand <em>how</em> Lore makes it easier to get started with React, the project structure, and the design
    philosophy behind the framework, please see this video.
