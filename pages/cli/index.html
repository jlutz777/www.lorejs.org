# CLI
The CLI for Lore is intended to be a complimentary utility to the framework itself. As the CLI evolves, it will
include the ability to write your own plugins for it, so you can extend or tailor its behavior.

## Generator Categories

### New
Used to create a new project.

### Generators
Generators are used to add common files (like components, actions, reducers) to your project, and include flags
for generating those files in ES5, ES6 or ESNext style syntax. The generators can be especially useful when you
need to override a default action or reducer.
