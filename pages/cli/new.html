# new
CLI command to create a new project.

### Usage

```
lore new [app-name]
```

### Example
Let's say you want to create a project called `my-awesome-app`. To do that, you would run this command:

```
lore new my-awesome-app
```

Next you need to install the project dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Once the project finishes building, you can visit the application at `localhost:3000`.

Note that `npm start` is really just an alias for `node server`, so you also run this:

```
npm install
node server
```

### Changing the Port
By default the project is served from localhost:3000, but if you want to use a different port you can
change it by passing the port in as an argument to the `node server` version of the startup command
(this won't work with `npm start`):

```
node server --port=3001
```
