# Purpose
Because docs are only useful to a point, and then you need to some working code to better understand.

Lore has some examples [in its source code](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples). If
there is a specific example you'd like to see that doesn't exist, feel free to
[create an issue to suggest it](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues).
