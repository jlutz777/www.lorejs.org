# 404 Pages
Useful for providing the user with a clear indication that what they're looking for does not exist, as infinite
loaders and blank pages are both poor user experiences.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what 404 pages look like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em>
prototype that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.

  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 drop-shadow pretty-embed" data-pe-videoid="s_jWh7h_j1w">
  </div>
</div>

### Usage
Need to add example code showing how to display 404 pages in a Lore application.
