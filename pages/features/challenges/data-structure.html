# Data Structure
Enables data-driven components by supplying components with both data and context.

### Visualization
This video describes the data structure Lore uses to enable data-driven components.

### Usage
Providing the user with visual feedback about what's happening in an application is _extremely_ important for providing
a good user experience. In order to do that, the data components receives needs to be self-describing. That means that
no matter what is happening in the application, or what response the API returned for a request, the data structure
you use must be able to represent it, so that all the information a component needs in order to know what to render
is contained in the data it receives.

There are two data containers in Lore; a `model` and a `collection`.

<br/>

#### Models
A `model` in Lore represents a single resource, such as a single 'Post' the API might return from
`https://api.myapp.com/posts/1`. The default data structure for a model looks like this:

```js
post = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'UPDATING',
  data: {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Cornbread is yummy'
  },
  error: {}
}
```

While this structure may seem excessive at first, each property was chosen to address a different use case and all are
necessary to make sure components can be entirely data-driven:

* <strong>id</strong>: this field is the unique id assigned by the server (number, string, uuid, etc) and is necessary
for updating and deleting data.

* <strong>cid</strong>: this field is a client-side id assigned by Lore, and is unique for the lifetime of the
application (it resets when you reload the application). It is necessary for supporting optimistic updates (displaying
data in the application before it exists in the API)

* <strong>state</strong>: this field represents what is _happening_ to the resource, such as whether it is being
created or updated, or whether there was an API error while fetching the resource. It is necessary in order to
communicate to the user what is _happening_ to data.

* <strong>data</strong>: this field contains the JSON data returned by the server and is necessary to display
meaningful _content_ in the application.

* <strong>error</strong>: this field captures any API errors that are returned (400/500 errors) and is necessary to
communicate to the user _what went wrong_.

<br/>

#### Collections
A `collection` in Lore represents a collection of resources, such as a list of 'Posts' the API might return from
`https://api.myapp.com/posts`. The default data structure for a collection looks like this:

```js
post = {
  state: 'FETCHING',
  data: [],
  query: {
    where: { authorId: '123' },
    pagination: { page: 1 }
  },
  meta: {},
  error: {}
}
```

Similar to models, each property was chosen to address a different use case and all are necessary to make sure
components can be entirely data-driven:

* <strong>state</strong>: this field represents what is _happening_ to the resource, such as whether it is being
fetched, or whether there was an API error while fetching the resources. It is necessary in order to communicate
to the user what is _happening_ to data.

* <strong>data</strong>: this field contains the JSON data returned by the server and is necessary to display
meaningful _content_ in the application. When the array is populated, it is populated with a list of `model` resources,
each having the data structure described above.

* <strong>query</strong>: this field contains a description of what this data _is_. Specfically, it contains the
`where` clause that describe what _criteria_ the data matches (such as posts by a specific author) and a `pagination`
clause that describes the _slice_ of data (such as which page and how many results exists in a page). It is necessary
for displaying information about the data and for creating pagination controls.

* <strong>meta</strong>: this field contains any metadata information provided by the server that you need to associate
with the data. It is necessary for communicating to the user the total number of matching resources (when the API
provides it) or something like rate-limiting information, if the API communicates the number of requests left in the
allotted period.

* <strong>error</strong>: this field captures any API errors that are returned (400/500 errors) and is necessary to
communicate to the user _what went wrong_.
