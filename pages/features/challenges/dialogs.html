<div>
  <h1>Dialogs (upcoming)</h1>
  <p>
    Lore will be providing a set a utilities to match launching dialogs easier while also addressing common problems
    associated with them.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      NOTE: Lore <em>sort of</em> has a dialog implementation, which you can see in the
      <a href="/examples/dialogs-querying/">Dialog & Querying</a> example, but the implementation is too specific to
      the <a href="http://www.material-ui.com/">material-ui</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature is about providing a generic adapter that you can plug into that will be library independent, so
      it would work with Bootstrap, Material UI, or any other library or custom implementation.
    </p>

    dialogs.
