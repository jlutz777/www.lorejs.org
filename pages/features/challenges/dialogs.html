# Dialogs
Useful for launching a user experience outside the UI of the main application. You can think of dialogs as mini-apps
you launchto perform a task, and may reuse in multiple places in the application.

## Usage
The first thing we need before we launch a dialog is a place to mount it. If you take a look at the `index.html` file
at the root of your project, you'll notice two tags in the body; one with an `id` of `root` and one with an `id`
of `dialog`:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <div id="dialog"></div>
</body>
```

The `root` tag is where the main application is mounted. The `dialog` tag is where dialogs get mounted.

> Lore intentionally mounts dialogs outside of the main application for two reasons:
>
> 1. Mounting a dialog _within_ a component makes it susceptible to the CSS cascade, which means the styling of the
dialog could be affected by the component that launches it (where it's placed in the DOM).
> 2. Mounting a dialog _within_ a component also allows components higher in the DOM to cancel event bubbling, which
could lead to typing and click events not behaving as expected in the dialog.

#### Mounting a Dialog
Now that we have a place to put our dialogs, let's mount one. Lore includes hook called `dialog` that provides a
utility for launching dialogs at `lore.dialog.show()`, but in reality this hook just mounts a component to the
`dialog` tag and gives it access to the Redux `store` and the `router` from React-Router. To mount a component you
invoke it like this:

```jsx
var Dialog = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div>
        Dialog Placeholder
      </div>
    );
  }
});

React.createClass({
  onLaunchDialog: function() {
    lore.dialog.show(function() {
      return (
        <Dialog />
      );
    });
  },

  render: function() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.onLaunchDialog}>
        Launch Dialog
      </button>
    );
  }
})
```

Calling `lore.dialog.show()` as above will modify the DOM to look like this (injecting our component into the
`dialog` tag):

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <div id="dialog">
    <div>
      Dialog Placeholder
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

At first glance this may not seem that useful, but some important callouts may help highlight the value:

1. The utility makes sure to unmount the previous component, so even when launching the same dialog back-to-back,
the state will always be reset and input fields will never contain data from the previous experience.

2. By making sure the Redux `store` exists in context, the dialogs (or any dialogs steps) will be able to make use of
`lore.connect` to request data, fire actions, and get notified when the store updates.

<br/>

#### Creating a Dialog
Creating dialogs themselves is actually outside the scope of this utility, as there are too many interfaces and
animations to predict. So instead, this utility simply mounts and configures the dialog, and then expects the
dialog itself to insert itself into the UI. For example, if we were creating a Bootstrap dialog, we would change
our `Dialog` component above to look like this:

```jsx
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

var Dialog = React.createClass({

  propTypes: {
    onSubmit: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired
  },

  componentDidMount: function() {
    this.show();
  },

  show: function() {
    var node = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this);
    $(node).modal('show');
  },

  dismiss: function() {
    var node = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this);
    $(node).modal('hide');
  },

  onSubmit: function() {
    this.dismiss();
    this.props.onSubmit(this.state);
  }

  render: function() {
    return (
      <div className="modal fade">
        <div className="modal-dialog">
          <div className="modal-content">
            <div className="modal-header">
              <button type="button" className="close" data-dismiss="modal">
                <span>&times;</span>
              </button>
              <h4 className="modal-title">
                My Dialog
              </h4>
            </div>
            <div className="modal-body">
              <form>
                <div className="form-group">
                  <label className="control-label">
                    Input Field
                  </label>
                  <input type="text" className="form-control" />
                </div>
              </form>
            </div>
            <div className="modal-footer">
              <button className="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">
                Cancel
              </button>
              <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={this.onSubmit}>
                Submit
              </button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

While the `lore.dialog.show` utility will mount this component to the `dialog` tag, it _won't_ automatically launch
it and trigger the "fade in" animation. That responsibility is left to the component. To address it, this component
calls `this.show()` when the component is mounted to the DOM, which will find the DOM element for this dialog and
call `modal('show')` to trigger the opening animation. Similarly, if the user submits the dialog, the component will
call `modal('hide')` to close the dialog.

<br/>

#### Acting on Dialog Data
The last step we need to account for is what to do with the _data_ the dialog generats. For that this component has
declared that it requires a `onSubmit` function through is props, and it will pass it's state data to that function
when the user submits it. Invoking this specific dialog would then look like this:

```jsx
var Dialog = require('../dialogs/ExampleDialog');

React.createClass({
  onLaunchDialog: function() {
    function onSubmit(data) {
      lore.actions.post.create(data);
    }

    lore.dialog.show(function() {
      return (
        <Dialog onSubmit={onSubmit} />
      );
    });
  },

  render: function() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.onLaunchDialog}>
        Launch Dialog
      </button>
    );
  }
})
```

Now when the dialog is submitted, the data will be passed to the `post.create` action and a new post will be created.

## Auto-Generated Dialogs
Dialogs, especially early in application development, have a lot of boilerplate associated with them. And creating
them, especially if we just need a way to create, edit and delete data as move the application forward, can slow
down development of more important areas of the application.

To help address that, there are two hooks you can install that provide examples of how to auto-generate dialogs if you
provide some additional information about fields and types to your models. One hook demonstrates this for Bootstrap
dialogs and the second hook demonstrates this for Material UI dialogs.

If you'd like to try them out or see how they work, please see the [
Bootstrap Dialog example](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/dialogs-bootstrap) or the
[Material UI Dialog example](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/dialogs-material-ui).
