# Dialogs
Lore will be providing a set a utilities to match launching dialogs easier while also addressing common problems
associated with them.

> NOTE: Lore _sort of_ has a dialog implementation, which you can see in the
> [Dialog & Querying](/examples/dialogs-querying/) example, but the implementation is too specific to
> the [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) library.
>
> This feature is about providing a generic adapter that you can plug into that will be library independent, so
> it would work with Bootstrap, Material UI, or any other library or custom implementation.

### Visualization
Need to add a video demonstrating what dialogs look like.

### Common Problems With Dialogs
Need to provide a list of the things Lore is solving for in providing utilities and opinions surround launching
dialogs.
