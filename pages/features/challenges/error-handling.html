# Error Handling
Useful for informing the user when things don't go as planned and providing them with the ability to correct
the error and try again.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what error handling looks like. Screenshots are from the _Simply Social_
prototype that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.
