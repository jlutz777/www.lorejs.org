  <h1>Infinite Scrolling</h1>
  <p>
    Mobile friendly style of pagination that aggregates fetched data into a single scrollable list.
  </p>

  <h3>Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    This video demonstrates what infinite scrolling looks like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em>
    prototype that <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> provides you when you sign up for an account.

  <h3>Architecture Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    The core challenge here is recognizing that Infinite Scrolling is primarily a view concern, in that it's exactly the
    same as traditional pagination except for how the data is displayed to the user.
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture Implementation</h3>
  <p>
    Since Infinite Scrolling shares the same infrastructure as traditional pagination, please see
    <a href="/features/challenges/pagination/">Pagination</a> for a description of how to implement support for it.
  </p>

  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>
    For a demonstration of pagination in action, please see the <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/infinite-scrolling">infinite-scrolling example</a>.
