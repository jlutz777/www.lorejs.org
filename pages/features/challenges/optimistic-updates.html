# Optimistic Updates
Useful for providing the application with a feeling a snappy responsiveness by assuming server calls will
be successful.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what optimistic updates looks like. Screenshots are from the _Simply Social_
prototype that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.

### Usage
While optimistically updating data can provide a good user experience, implementing it can be a little tricky, as
you are adding data to an application _before_ it exists, and then you need to _sync_ that data with a server response
when it comes back. If done incorrectly, you can easily end up with duplicate data in your application, and you may
end up seeing the optimistic data being displayed _next_ to the real data instead of being merged _with_ it.

Let's go through an example to illustrate the issue to demonstrate how Lore addresses it.

Let's say you have an API with a `/posts` endpoint, and you want to create a new post. Somewhere in your application
you'll make a call to the `post.create` action like this:

```js
lore.action.post.create({
  title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
})
```

This will then send a network request to the API server that looks like this:

```
POST http://api.example.com/posts

{
  title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
}
```

Now while that network request is in flight, the `create` blueprint is still going to fire action to the Redux store
describing the data the user just "created". That action will look like this:

```js
action = {
  type: 'ADD_POST',
  payload: {
    id: undefined,
    cid: 'c1',
    state: 'CREATING',
    data: {
      title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
    },
    error: {}
  }
}
```

The `action.type` field tells the reducers that we need to ADD this POST to the Redux store. Once that happens, the
application will rerender. Now let's say we have a component renders a list of posts:

```js
@lore.connect(function(getState, props) {
  return {
    posts: getState('post.find')
  };
})
class Component extends React.Component {

  static propTypes = {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  };

  renderPost: function(post) {
    return (
      <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
    );
  },

  render() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    return (
      <ul>
        {posts.data.map(this.renderPost)}
      </ul>
    )
  }
};
```

One problem we'll hit quickly is that React will throw a warning because `post.id` is `undefined`, which means the key
won't exist. It won't necessary damage the user experience, but we do want to fix React warnings. This is one use for
the `cid` field; acting as a fallback when the id doesn't exist. So if we change our `renderPost` to this the warning
will go away (we'll use the `cid` if the `id` is undefined):

```js
@lore.connect(function(getState, props) {
  return {
    posts: getState('post.find')
  };
})
class Component extends React.Component {

  static propTypes = {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  };

  renderPost: function(post) {
    return (
      <Post key={post.id || post.cid} post={post} />
    );
  },

  render() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    return (
      <ul>
        {posts.data.map(this.renderPost)}
      </ul>
    )
  }
};
```

Now that's *a* problem but it's not *the* problem. *The* problem happens when the real data comes back from the
server. Let's pretend this is the response from the API server:

```
201 https://api.myapp.com/posts

{
  id: 1,
  title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
}
```

The issue is this: the `create` method needs to emit an action to populate the Redux store with server response, but
_how do we let the reducers know this is the same data_? Normally an `id` is used to anchor data, to say _this and
that are the same thing_. But we added our optimstic data before the id existed...so what do we do?

The answer lies in the `cid` field Lore adds to all data that gets fetched or created. To illustrate let's take a
look at a simplified blueprint for the `create` method:

```js
module.exports = function create(params) {
  return function(dispatch) {
    var model = new Post(params);

    model.save().then(function() {
      dispatch({
        type: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
        payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.RESOLVED)
      });
    }).catch(function(response) {
      var error = response.data;

      dispatch({
        type: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
        payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING, error)
      });
    });

    return dispatch({
      type: ActionTypes.ADD_POST,
      payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.CREATING)
    });
  };
};
```

See the call to create the Post at the top, that looks like `var model = new Post(params)`? The `Post` constructor
there is an instance of [lore-models](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-models), the interface
and behavior of which is heavilty inspired by [Backbone's Models and Collections](http://backbonejs.org/). Once the
post instance is created, the data for the resulting `model` looks like this:

```js
model = {
  id: undefined,
  cid: 'c1',
  attributes: {
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  }
}
```

So the `cid` is actually created when the Post `model` is created. These models are used as the AJAX abstraction tier
for Lore, and when we invoke `model.save()` the network request is sent to the API server to create the Post resource.
The dispatch call at the bottom of the `create` method creates and dispatches the action containing the optimistic
data.

Once the network request comes back, the promise after `model.save()` is fulfilled, and we dispatch another action. But
this time the data in the `model` looks like this:

```js
model = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  attributes: {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  }
}
```

The trick here is that the _same function_ dispatches both the optimistic update _AND_ the update once real data
exists. Because of this, we're able to hold onto the original `cid`, and our second action will look like this:

```js
action = {
  type: 'UPDATE_POST',
  payload: {
    id: 1,
    cid: 'c1',
    state: 'RESOLVED',
    data: {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
    },
    error: {}
  }
}
```

Now the reducers in the Redux store know they should UPDATE the POST, and because all data fetched or created will have
a `cid` the reducers can match data based on `cid` if the `id` doesn't exist. And that's exactly what happens. The
first ADD_POST action is added to the Redux store, and the store can tell it's missing an `id`. So when the second
UPDATE_POST action is dispatched later, the reducers can use to `cid` field to know what data is the same and merge it
together.

It's important to re-iterate that this method _only works because the optimistic and real responses are part of the
same method context_. This approach _DOES NOT_ work for WebSockets, because there is no equivalent "wait for server
response" option. Instead, the `cid` needs to be sent _to the server_ and included _in the response_. Provided you do
that, you can handle optimistic updates using WebSockets without any issues, and the same principle to add and
update/merge the data applies.
