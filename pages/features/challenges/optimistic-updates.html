# Optimistic Updates
Useful for providing the application with a feeling a snappy responsiveness by assuming server calls will
be successful.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what optimistic updates looks like. Screenshots are from the _Simply Social_
prototype that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.

<div class="video">
  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 drop-shadow pretty-embed" data-pe-videoid="y9SoJJqR_C8">
  </div>
</div>

### Usage
Need to add example code showing how to visualize optimistic updates in a Lore application.
