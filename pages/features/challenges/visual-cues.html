# Visual Cues
Useful for providing the user with a visual indication that some action is being performed but has no yet
completed. Examples include fetching, updating and creating data.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what visual cues look like. Screenshots are from the _Simply Social_ prototype
that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.

<div class="video">
  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 drop-shadow pretty-embed" data-pe-videoid="6uJ7Y6p7eBU" data-pe-fitvids="true">
  </div>
</div>

### Usage
Need to add example code showing how to display visual cues in a Lore application.

{% endcapture %}
{{ markdown | markdownify }}
