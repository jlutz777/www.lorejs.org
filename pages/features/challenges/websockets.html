# WebSockets (beta)
Provides the ability for an application's data to update without requiring the user to refresh the page. Especially
useful in applications where multiple people view and interact with the same data, especially when data changes
at a high frequency.

> NOTE: This feature is still in the proposal stage, but the implementation approach Lore will likely follow is
> provided below. Support for WebSockets will be implemented after pagination, infinite scrolling, and dialogs
> are supported.

<h3>Visualization</h3>
