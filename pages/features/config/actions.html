# config/actions.js

This file is connected to the `lore-hook-actions` hook and overrides the default action behaviors.

### Configuration Options
There are no configuration options currently, but there are plans to support disabling the blueprints and allowing
you to provide a custom override for each blueprint without having to override the entire `lore-hook-actions` hook.
