# config/collections.js

This file is connected to the `lore-hook-collections` hook and overrides the default collection behaviors.

## Purpose

There are three things you commonly need when making AJAX calls from the browser:

1. The URL of the API server (such as `https://api.example.com`)
2. The path to the endpoint we're interested in (such as `/posts`)
3. A method to parse the server response and extract the data the client side needs

This config file allows you to express the needs that are common across all models, so that you only have to define
them once. All individual collections inherit this behavior, with the ability to override it as they need to.

> NOTE: This file inherits behavior from `config/models.js` so you don't need to set any values here that are already set there.

## Example Config File
```
{
  apiRoot: 'https://api.example.com',

  pluralize: true,

  properties: {
    url: 'https://api.example.com/posts',
    parse: function(attributes) {
      return attributes;
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Options
#### apiRoot
This the root URL of the API server, inherited from `config/models.js`.

#### pluralize
Used to set whether Lore should pluralize API paths generated using conventions. Inherited from `config/models.js`.

#### properties
> NOTE: This field is NOT inherited from `config/models.js`

All of the collections in Lore are converted to Collection instances from the
[lore-models](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-models) package. This field can be used to set
any of the default behaviors, the most commonly needed ones being:

* `url`: used to set the path to the API endpoint for a resource that doesn't match Lore's conventions
* `parse`: used to extract resource information from a server response with a metadata wrapper
