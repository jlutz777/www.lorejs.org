# config/connect.js

This file is connected to the `lore-hook-connect` hook and overrides the default connect behaviors.

### Configuration Options
There are no configuration options at the moment, although the `connect` hook does use the
`config/actionReducerMap.js` file to determine which actions should be invoked based on the reducer state request.

> The `config/actionReducerMap.js` config needs to be merged into this file.
