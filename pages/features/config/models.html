# config/models.js

This file is connected to the `lore-hook-models` hook and overrides the default model behaviors.

## Purpose

There are three things you commonly need when making AJAX calls from the browser:

1. The URL of the API server (such as `https://api.example.com`)
2. The path to the endpoint we're interested in (such as `/posts`)
3. A method to parse the server response and extract the data the client side needs

This config file allows you to express the needs that are common across all models, so that you only have to define
them once. All individual models inherit this behavior, with the ability to override it as they need to.

## Example Config File
```
{
  apiRoot: 'https://api.example.com',

  pluralize: true,

  properties: {
    idAttribute: 'id',
    urlRoot: 'https://api.example.com/posts',
    parse: function(attributes) {
      return attributes;
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Options
#### apiRoot
This the root URL of the API server. If your application only uses a single API, then this is the only location you
need to set it. If your application consumes multiple API servers, then you'll need to override this property on a
per-model or per-collection basis.

#### pluralize
This setting is used when generating API paths using conventions. For example, if you have a model called `post`
and `pluralize` is set to `true`, then conventions will assume the endpoint is located at `{apiRoot}/posts`. If
`pluralize` is set to false, the conventions will assume the endpoint is located at `{apiRoot}/post`.

#### properties
All of the models in Lore are converted to Model instances from the [lore-models](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-models)
package. This field can be used to set any of the default behaviors, the most commonly needed ones being:

* `idAttribute`: used when your unique id field is not called `id`
* `parse`: used to extract resource information from a server response with a metadata wrapper
* `urlRoot`: used to set the path to the API endpoint for a resource that doesn't match Lore's conventions
