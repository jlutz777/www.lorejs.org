# config/router.js

This file is used by Lore core and overrides the default router behaviors.

> The routing behavior will likely be broken out of Lore core and moved to `lore-hook-router` to match the conventions
of the other config files and continue to externalize more of Lore's behaviors into overridable hooks.

## Example Config File

```js
var browserHistory = require('react-router').browserHistory;

module.exports = {
  history: browserHistory
};
```

## Configuration Options
#### history
The [type of router history](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md) you
want to use in your application. Typically `browserHistory` if you want to use pushState routes like
`https://www.myapp.com/posts/1`or `hashHistory` if you want to use hash-bang (#) style routes like
`https://www.myapp.com/#/posts/1`.
