<h1>Config</h1>
<p>
  An explanation of all config files, their options, and their role.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    This section is currently very empty, but will be filled in gradually as the related features of Lore are
    better supported and/or documented. In the meantime, each config file is somewhat self-documented, so feel free
    to explore and <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/issues">file an issue</a> if you have any questions.
