# Publishing to GitHub Pages
Instructions for publishing to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

> At the moment, GitHub Pages is more complicated to publish to than Surge, so if you're not comfortable
> with Gulp or changing DNS settings to create a CNAME, it's recommended you don't use this approach until there
> is a more streamlined solution in place.

### Video Demonstration
This will be added in the future.

### Install the Gulp Task
To publish your project to GitHub Pages first install the gulp task to do so:

{% highlight bash %}
lore generate github
{% endhighlight %}

This task will automatically install any dependencies and add them to the `devDependencies` in your
`package.json`.

### Publish Your Project
Next you'll need to run the gulp task to publish your project:

```bash
gulp github
```

This task will build your project for production, create branch called `gh-pages`, and push your code
into it.

Once this completes your code will be available at `http://[username].github.io/[repository]`, where
`username` is your GitHub username and `repository` is the name of your repository. For
example, if your username was `fluffykittens` and you were creating an application called
`furballs`, your application would be available at  `http://fluffykittens.github.io/furballs`.

<!--<h3>Publish Your Project to a User Repository</h3>-->
<!--<p>-->
  <!--If you want to publish your project instead to a [user or organization webpage](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user&#45;&#45;organization-pages),-->
  <!--like `http://fluffykittens.github.io` with no project extension (like /furballs) then you'll need to make-->
  <!--sure your repository is named  `[username].github.io`. When you publish, you'll also need to add an-->
  <!--argument for the branch to set it to `master`.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--{% highlight bash %}-->
<!--gulp github &#45;&#45;branch=master-->
<!--{% endhighlight %}-->

### Why Can't I See My Application?
Once you publish, your application won't work on GitHub Pages because it doesn't get surged from the root of
the domain. If you look at the `index.html` file at the root of your project, you'll see this script
being loaded:

```html
<script src="/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

This script pulls in your code, but the url expects the code to be located at
`http://fluffykittens.github.io/dist/bundle.js`. But since your project is being served from
`/furballs/`, and not `/`, you'll need to change this file to look like this:

```html
<script src="/furballs/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

With that in place, your code will load, but you'll still see a blank page. This is because the app is now being
served from `/furballs/`, and React-Router doesn't know that. Your `routes.js` expects the
application to be served from `/`:

```jsx
module.exports = (
<Route component={Master}>
  <Route path="/" component={Layout} />
</Route>
);
```

To fix that, you'll also need to change your `routes.js` file so that the root route is the repository
of your application, like this:

```jsx
module.exports = (
<Route component={Master}>
  <Route path="/furballs/" component={Layout} />
</Route>
);
```

With those changes in place, once you redploy, your application should work on GitHub Pages.

### Non-Modification Option

If you don't want to modify your files to be served from `/furballs/`, your other option is to [create
a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) so that your application
can be served from `http://www.furballs.com`.

If you want to go this approach and buy a custom domain, and don't already have a DNS provider (or want to switch
from the one you currently have), I highly recommend [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com).
