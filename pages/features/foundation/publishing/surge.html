# Publishing to Surge
Instructions for publishing to [Surge](https://surge.sh).

### Video Demonstration
This will be added in the future.

### Install the Gulp Task
To publish your project to GitHub Pages first install the gulp task to do so:

{% highlight bash %}
lore generate surge
{% endhighlight %}

This task will automatically install any dependencies and add them to the `devDependencies` in your
`package.json`.

### Publish Your Project
Next you'll need to run the gulp task to publish your project:

```bash
gulp surge
```

This task will build your project for production and push your code to Surge. If you don't pass in a domain,
Surge will generate a random one for you and you'll need to confirm it during the build. If you already have a
domain in mind you want to use, you can pass that to the task and it will use it instead:

```bash
gulp surge --domain=my-app.surge.sh
```

{% endcapture %}
