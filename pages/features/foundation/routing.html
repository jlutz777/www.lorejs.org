<h1>Routing</h1>
<p>
  This section documents the parts of Lore that are directly relevant to React-Router. For now that means how to
  specify your routes and change the default config settings for React-Router.
</p>

<p>
  The video below is an excerpt from the full <a href="/getting-started/introduction-to-lore/">Introduction to Lore</a>
  video and provides a summary of how Lore helps with routing.

<h2>Relevant Files</h2>
<p>
  The files below are worth calling out as especially relevant to React-Router in terms of where the routes are
  specified and how to change the router's default configuration settings.
</p>

<h3>routes.js</h3>
<p>
  This file is where you specify your route hierarchy. <code>Master</code> should always be the root component unless
  you really know what you're doing. <code>Layout</code> is a recommended pattern, but can be renamed or deleted
  without affecting the application (it's not special).
</p>

{% highlight js %}
import React from 'react';
import { Route, IndexRoute, Redirect } from 'react-router';

var Master = require('./src/components/Master');
var Layout = require('./src/components/Layout');

module.exports = (
  <Route component={Master}>
    <Route path="/" component={Layout} />
  </Route>
);
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>config/router.js</h3>
<p>
  This file is where you define overrides for the default routing behavior. Currently the only option here is how you
  want your routing displayed; using hash history or push state. You can find more information about these options
  on the <a href="https://github.com/ReactJSTraining/history">GitHub page for the `history` library</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    This config file will change as soon as Lore updates to using the v2 version of React-Router.
  </p>

{% highlight js %}
var createBrowserHistory = require('history/lib/createBrowserHistory');

module.exports = {
