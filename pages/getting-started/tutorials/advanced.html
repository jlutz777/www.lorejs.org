# Lore Tutorial: Advanced
Sadly, there is no tutorial yet for advanced developers, which (for the sake of providing a definition) means
*you have a built and supported a large client-facing React application*, ideally through at least
one major version change of the API.

This page will instead convey what the tutorial *will* include once it exists. If you'd like to be
part of the conversation and influence what will be in this tutorial, there
[there has been an issue created](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues/103) expressly for that purpose.
Love to hear your thoughts!

### The Application
TBD

### Concepts to be Covered
This tutorial is expected to cover the following concepts (building on the concepts from the intermediate tutorial):

1. Authorization (user permissions)
2. Interacting with multiple APIs
3. Protecting your app from breaking API changes
4. WebSockets integration (for real-time support)
5. Graceful error handling
6. 404 pages
