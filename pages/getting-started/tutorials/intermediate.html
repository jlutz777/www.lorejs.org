# Lore Tutorial: Intermediate
Sadly, there is no tutorial yet for intermediate developers, which (for the sake of providing a definition) means
*you have a built a small React application before* and have *a general comfort with consuming
  data from API endpoints*.

This page will instead convey what the tutorial *will* include once it exists. If you'd like to be
part of the conversation and influence what will be in this tutorial, there
[there has been an issue created](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues/102) expressly for that purpose.
Love to hear your thoughts!

### The Application
TBD

### Concepts to be Covered
This tutorial is expected to cover the following concepts (building on the concepts from the beginner tutorial):

1. Authentication
1. Launching dialogs
1. Extracting data from API responses wrapped in meta fields
1. Creating, Updating, and Deleting data
1. Pagination
1. Filtering
1. Displaying visual cues when data is being modified
