<h1>Lore Tutorial: Intermediate</h1>
<p>
  Sadly, there is no tutorial yet for intermediate developers, which (for the sake of providing a definition) means
  <strong>you have a built a small React application before</strong> and have <strong>a general comfort with consuming
  data from API endpoints</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  This page will instead convey what the tutorial <strong>will</strong> include once it exists. If you'd like to be
  part of the conversation and influence what will be in this tutorial, there
  <a href="https://github.com/lore/lore/issues/102">there has been an issue created</a> expressly for that purpose.
  Love to hear your thoughts!
</p>

<h3>The Application</h3>
<p>
  TBD
