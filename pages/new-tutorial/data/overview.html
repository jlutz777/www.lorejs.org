# Data Structure: Overview

In this section we'll learn about why the data structure you use in your React applications is important, and then
we'll mock out some data and create our Tweet component. At the end of this section your application will look like this:

<img class="drop-shadow" src="/assets/images/new-tutorial/data/step-3.png">

## Video Explanation
The following video provides a visual explanation of why the data structure you use is important.

<div class="video" style="padding-top: 16px;">
  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 drop-shadow pretty-embed" data-pe-videoid="kSAseqgjihE">
  </div>
</div>

## Written Explanation

### Why is data structure important?
When I refer to data structure I'm talking about the data passed into your components through props. For example, in
this section we'll be creating a Tweet component and providing it with a tweet. The shell of that component will look
like this:

```jsx
var React = require('react');

module.exports = React.createClass({
  displayName: 'Tweet',

  propTypes: {
    tweet: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function () {
    var tweet = this.props.tweet;

    return (
      {/* render tweet */}
    );
  }
});
```

So if we want to render the text of the tweet, how do we get that property? Well, if we take a look at our API endpoint,
we can see the structure of a tweet looks like this:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  user: 4,
  text: "Where have they been keeping her!?",
  createdAt: "2016-10-17T23:13:07.249Z",
  updatedAt: "2016-10-23T23:13:07.281Z"
}
```

One option, and arguably the simplest, would be to pass that data directly to the component. And if we do that we
can get the text of the tweet by accessing `tweet.text`. But simple as that is, we're not going to do that, because it
can cause a lot of challenges later on and limit the types of experiences we can provide to users.

### Data-Driven Components
The reason the scenario above is problematic is because there's no context to the data. If you're creating an application
that is 100% read-only, then it doesn't actually pose a problem. But once you allow users to create, edit and delete
data the issues with that structure become more apparent.

For example, what if the user tries to update that data? How do you know if that data is the original data or the data
the user modified? What if there's an error updating the data? How will you communicate that to the component? How will
you even know what the error was? What if the data doesn't exist because you're trying to fetch it, but you still need
to know it's being fetched to display a loading experience?

That's just a handful of scenarios that real-world applications need to deal with, and the simple data structure above
is woefully unprepared to communicate.

### Lore's Data Structure
To address these challenges, Lore wraps _all_ data that comes back from the server in a structure that is capapble of
communicating that context. For our tweet data above, that structure looks like this:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'RESOLVED',
  data: {
    id: 1,
    user: 4,
    text: "Where have they been keeping her!?",
    createdAt: "2016-10-17T23:13:07.249Z",
    updatedAt: "2016-10-23T23:13:07.281Z"
  },
  error: {}
}
```

Not all of these fields will make sense at the moment (especially the cid) but each field exists to simplify application
development and enable a broad range of real-world user experience needs. If you want to learn more about Lore's data
structure right now, you can find a full description in the [docs for the data structure](/features/foundation/data-structure/),
which includes a short video elaborating on the structure and why it's important.

If you'd prefer to carry on with the tutorial, the important part for now is that the data from the server will be
stored in the `data` property, so the text for the tweet will be accessed through `lore.data.text`.
