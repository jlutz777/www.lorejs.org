# Step 1: Set API Server Location

In this step we're going to learn how to set the location of the API server.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore tutorial step8
```

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

## Written Steps

### The Config Folder
Before we can fetch data from our API server we need to tell Lore where our API server is located. At the root of
your project you should see a folder called `config`. This folder exposes all of the toggles and knobs you can use to
tailor Lore's behavior to your specific needs.

Navigate into this folder and open a file called `models.js`. Toward the top of this file you should see a commented
out line that looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  // apiRoot: 'https://api.example.com',
}
```

You'll see commented out sections like this in all of the config files, and they represent the built-in defaults that
Lore uses. In this case, Lore assumes you're API is located at `https://api.example.com` which is obviously not going
to be true. So let's tell Lore where our API is located by uncommenting out this line and changing it to the following:

```js
module.exports = {
  apiRoot: 'http://localhost:1337',
}
```

With this change in place, we're almost ready to fetch data. But first, we need to talk about what `models` are.

> Aside: Environment-specific Configuration
> While we won't cover it in this tutorial, you'll notice there is a `/env` folder in `/config` that contains files
> called `development.js` and `production.js`. These files allow you to override or add configuration settings that only
> apply to that environment. For example, if you're NODE_ENV is set to `development`, the final configuration will be
> all of the files located in `/config`, overriden by any settings you've specified in `/config/development.js`. The
> `/config/local.js` file ONLY applies to your local environment, and is added to the .gitignore file by default, so it
> will never be checked.

### Models
If you navigate to the URL `http://localhost:1337/tweets/1` you might see a response like that looks like this:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  user: 1,
  text: 'Nothing can beat science!',
  createdAt: '2016-10-04T05:10:49.382Z'
}
```

One way to think of this data is as a `model` of a `tweet`; it models what was said and who said it. In Lore, there is
a concept called a `model` that understands how to interact with this endpoint. For example, in this tutorial we'll soon
be creating a `tweet` model, and this model will know how to fetch, create, update and delete tweets.

But the endpoints within an API often share a lot of common conventions, and having to redefine these conventions (like
the root URL for the API server) would be a lot of duplication of information. This config file exists as a way to define
that common behavior in a single location, and all models in the application will inherit those properties.

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this. Exactly the same before :)

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

### config/models.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "Diff", "id": 1} | tab2={"name": "Source", "id": 2} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
![New Lore App](/assets/images/new-tutorial/diffs/fetching/step-1-config-models.png)
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```js
module.exports = {
  apiRoot: 'http://localhost:1337'
};
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [create our tweet model](../step-2/).
