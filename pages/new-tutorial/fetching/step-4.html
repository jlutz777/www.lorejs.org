# Step 4: Parse Server Response

In this step we'll learn about Collections and how to parse our server response to extract the array of tweets.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore tutorial stepXYZ
```

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

<div class="video" style="padding-top: 16px;">
  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 drop-shadow pretty-embed" data-pe-videoid="5VWiX0O4LKA">
  </div>
</div>

## Written Steps

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this.

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

### config/collections.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "Diff", "id": 1} | tab2={"name": "Source", "id": 2} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
![config](/assets/images/new-tutorial/diffs/fetching/step-4-config-collections.png)
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```jsx
module.exports = {
  properties: {
    parse: function(attributes) {
      return attributes.data;
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [fetch the user for each tweet](../step-5/).
