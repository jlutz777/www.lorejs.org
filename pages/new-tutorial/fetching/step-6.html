# Step 6: Display Loading Message

In this step we're going to use the `state` property on the data structure to display a loading message while the
tweets are being fetching.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore tutorial stepXYZ
```

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

  </div>
</div>

## Written Steps

### Visual Check-in
