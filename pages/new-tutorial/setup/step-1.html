# Installing the CLI

Before you can use Lore you will first need to install Node.  If you don't already have it installed, please refer to
[these instructions](../../misc/installing-node/).

The easiest way to get started with Lore is by installing the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI will let you create
a starter project, and also provides some utility functions like file generators and helpers to publish your project to
the web (if you've ever used Rails or Sails it's similar to their CLIs).

```sh
$ npm install -g lore-cli
```

Once the CLI is installed you will have access to `lore` from the command line.
Run lore to see a list of options:

```sh
$ lore

Usage: $ <command>

  Commands:
    new       Create a new application
    tutorial  Generate files for the tutorial
    extract   Create files that mirror the blueprint behavior
    generate  Generate common project files


  Options:
    --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
    --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]

  Please enter a valid command.
```

## Next Steps

Now that the `lore-cli` is installed, let's [create a new application](../step-2/).
