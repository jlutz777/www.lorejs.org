# Creating A New Project

To create a new Lore app, type `lore new` into the command line followed the by name of your application. For this
example we are going to call our application `lore-tutorial`.

### Create a new app

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial
```

This will create a new directory called `lore-tutorial`, and place all the necessary files inside. You should see
this message when the task completes.

```sh
  info:  Created a new Lore application `lore-tutorial`
```

### Optional: Create an ES6 and ESNext version of the app

Lore currently defaults to creating a project using ES5 syntax. If you'd prefer to use ES6, you can change the default
by passing in an optional command line argument:

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial --es6
```

If you'd prefer to use cutting-room floor features in ESNext (such as decorators and static property types), you can
generate a project using that syntax by passing in `--esnext` like this:

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial --esnext
```

This will make it so that all files in the project are generated using ES6 syntax, and also adds a setting in the `.lorerc`
file that will cause all the generators to create their files in ES6 as well. In an upcoming release, Lore will also add an
option for using ESNext syntax.

> NOTE: While the tutorial will allow you to automatically generate files for each step (in case you get stuck or
> don't want to code that step yourself) those files are currently only generating using ES5 as the tutorial is still
> in a little bit of flux. Once it settles down, all tutorial files will be available for generation in ES6 and ESNext
> syntax as well.

### Install Dependencies

Once the project is created, navigate into the directory and install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd lore-tutorial
$ npm install
```

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [start the application](../step-3/) and view it in a browser.
