# Start the Application

Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can start the app by running `npm start`.

```sh
$ npm start
```

This step kicks off Webpack and builds the project.  A successful execution should produce output similar to this:

```sh
  [420] ./~/lore/lib/Hook.js 286 bytes {0} [built]
  [421] ./~/lore/lib/app/getInitializers.js 217 bytes {0} [built]
  [422] ./~/lore/lib/app/sortHooksByLoadOrder.js 878 bytes {0} [built]
  [423] ./~/lore/~/topsort/lib/topsort.js 3.17 kB {0} [built]
  [424] ./~/lore/lib/app/getConfig.js 469 bytes {0} [built]

webpack: bundle is now VALID.
```

### View the App

At this point the application is built, and you can view it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your
browser.  You should see this:

### Changing the Port

If you want to change the port the server runs on, you can do that by using an alternate syntax to start the server.
`npm start` is just an alias for `node server`, and you can pass a `port` argument to `node server` like so:

``` sh
node server --port=3001
```

If you're using ES6 or ESNext for the project, you'll need to start the server using `babel-node` like this:

``` sh
./node_modules/.bin/babel-node server --port=3001
```

### Note
If you are using Chrome and you see this error in the network requests you can safely ignore it.

```sh
GET http://localhost:3000/service-worker.js net::ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE
```
