# Start the Application
In this step we'll be installing the project dependencies and learning how to view tha application in the browser.

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

  </div>
</div>

## Written Steps
Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can start the application by running `npm start`.

```sh
$ npm start
```

A successful execution should produce output similar to this:

```sh
  [431] ./~/lore-hook-reducers/lib/blueprints/byId.js 1.33 kB {0} [built]
  [432] ./~/lore-hook-reducers/lib/blueprints/byCid.js 2.48 kB {0} [built]
  [433] ./~/lore-hook-redux/lib/index.js 676 bytes {0} [built]
  [434] ./~/redux-thunk/lib/index.js 529 bytes {0} [built]
  [435] ./~/lore-hook-redux/lib/generateStore.js 497 bytes {0} [built]

webpack: bundle is now VALID.
```

This step does two things. First, it kicks off [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a popular build tool that will
bundle all the project files together so they can be served to a browser. And second, this command starts up a
development server that will serve that bundle so you can view the application.

### View the App

Once the application successfully builds, you can view it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your
browser. Once you do, you should see this:

### Optional: Change the Port

If you want to change the port the server runs on, you can do that by using an alternate syntax to start the server.
`npm start` is really just an alias for `node server`, and you can pass a `port` argument to `node server` like this:

``` sh
node server --port=3001
```

> **NOTE**: If you generated the project using ES6 or ESNext syntax, then you'll need to start the server using
> `babel-node` like this:
>
> ``` sh
> ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node server --port=3001
> ```

### Note
If you are using Chrome and you see this error in the network requests you can safely ignore it.

```sh
GET http://localhost:3000/service-worker.js net::ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE
```
