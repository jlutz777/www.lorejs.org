# Step 33: Adding a Header

In this step we're going to add a Header to our application, and learn about the `component` generator.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore generate tutorial step33
```

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this.

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

### config/actions.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "Diff", "id": 1} | tab2={"name": "Source", "id": 2} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
![New Lore App](/assets/images/tutorial/step2-diff-header.png)
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```js
module.exports = {
  addCidToBody: true,
};
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [DO SOMETHING](../step-2/).
