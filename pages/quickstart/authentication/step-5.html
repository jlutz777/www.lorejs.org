# Step 5: Add Logout Experience

In this step we're going to add a logout experience.

### Create the Logout Component
While we don't have a "logout page" in a visual sense, we still have behavior that we want executed when the user logs
out, such as removing their user token and redirecting them the login page. We're going to store this behavior in
a component so that we can have it occur when the user navigates to the `/logout` route.

To get started, create a `Logout` component:

```
lore generate component Logout
```

Update your Logout component to look like this:

```jsx
var React = require('react');
var auth = require('../utils/auth');

module.exports = React.createClass({
  displayName: 'Logout',

  propTypes: {
    router: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  componentDidMount: function(){
    auth.deleteToken();
    this.props.router.push('/');
  },

  render: function() {
    return (
      <h1 className="loading-text">
        Logging out...
      </h1>
    );
  }

});
```

### Add the /logout route
Next import your `Logout` component into `routes.js` and update the routes to look like this:

```jsx
var Logout = require('./src/components/Logout');

module.exports = (
  <Route>
    <Route path="/login" component={Login} />
    <Route path="/logout" component={Logout} />

    ...
  </Route>
);
```

### Connect Logout Button to /logout Route
Finally, we need to make it so that when the user clicks the `Logout` button in the `Profile` component they are
redirect to the `/logout` route, which will delete their user token and redirect them to the login page.

Locate the Logout button in your `Profile` component:

```jsx
<button className="btn btn-primary">
  Logout
</button>
```

Convert this button to a React Router `Link` and have it point to `/logout`:

```jsx
<Router.Link className="btn btn-primary" to="/logout">
  Logout
</Router.Link>
```

With this change in place, clicking the Logout button will redirect you to `/login`, and once you log in, you'll be
redirected to the main application.
