# Step 3: Lore Hooks / Dialog Generation

In this step we're going to create and mount a Bootstrap dialog.


### Add Hook for Dialog Generation
While we could go through the steps of manually creating dialogs for creating, updating and deleting tweets, it's
pretty tedious, and has little to do Lore. So instead, we're going to install a package that will generate the dialogs
for us.

While it may not be obvious, Lore is essentially a plugin engine. Most of the functionality and conventions you've
seen so far are implemented as a series of plugins that hook into the framework. We're going to download and
install an additional hooks that will generate our dialogs for us.

Run the following command to install the package `lore-hook-dialogs-bootstrap`:

```sh
npm install lore-hook-dialogs-bootstrap@~0.11.0-beta --save
```

Next open up `index.js` and locate the call for `lore.summon(...)`. Here you can see a list of all the hooks
the framework includes by default. You've already seen some of these in action; the `actions` hook converts your
models into actions, the `reducers` hook creates reducers for each of your models, and the `connect` hook adds
the `lore.connect` decorator that invokes actions to fetch data if it doesn't exist in the store.

```jsx
lore.summon({
  hooks: {
    auth: require('lore-hook-auth'),
    actions: require('lore-hook-actions'),
    bindActions: require('lore-hook-bind-actions'),
    collections: require('lore-hook-collections'),
    connections: require('lore-hook-connections'),
    connect: require('lore-hook-connect'),
    dialog: require('lore-hook-dialog'),
    models: require('lore-hook-models'),
    reducers: require('lore-hook-reducers'),
    redux: _.extend(require('lore-hook-redux'), {
      dependencies: ['reducers', 'auth']
    })
  }
});
```

To use the hook we just installed, simply add it to the `hooks` object like this:

```jsx
lore.summon({
  hooks: {
    ...
    dialog: require('lore-hook-dialog'),
    dialogs: require('lore-hook-dialogs-bootstrap'),
    models: require('lore-hook-models'),
    ...
  }
});
```

### Try it Out (optional)
This hook generates Bootstrap dialogs for every model in your application, and includes experiences for creating,
updating and deleting resources. Open up the developer console and enter the following command:

```js
lore.dialogs.tweet.create()
```

You'll see it returns a React component. If you provide this component to `lore.dialog.show(...)` you'll be able to
see the dialog be mounted onto the page:

```js
lore.dialog.show(function() { return lore.dialogs.tweet.create(); })
```

Right now the result isn't very useful, because there aren't any fields. We'll fix that in the next step.


### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this.
