# Step 4: Add Create Dialog

In this step we're going to finish our create dialog and have it send data to the server.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore quickstart step17
```

### Add attributes to Tweet model
The reason our dialog didn't have any fields in the previous step was because it didn't know what fields to generate.
To fix that open up your `tweet` model and list the attributes that describe the model. In this application, each tweet
has a `text` attribute that is of type `text` (the other supported options are 'string', 'number' and 'boolean'). Update
your `tweet` model in look like this:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    text: {
      type: 'text',
      displayName: 'Message',
      placeholder: "What's happening?"
    }
  }
};
```

### Launch Create Dialog
Open up your `CreateButton` component and modify the `onClick` handler to look like this:

```jsx
...
  onClick: function() {
    function createTweet(params) {
      console.log(params);
    }

    lore.dialog.show(function() {
      return lore.dialogs.tweet.create({
        onSubmit: createTweet
      });
    })
  },
...
```

This code generates a Create Tweet dialog provides an `onSubmit` data that will receive the data the user enters
when they create a tweet. To see it in action, refresh the page, add some text, and when you submit the data you
should see the data being logged in the console.

### Save the Tweet
Now we can launch a dialog and get the user input, but we aren't sending it to the API yet. Let's fix that. Instead of
logging the user data, we're going to pass it to the `tweet.create` action. Modify the `createTweet` callback in the
`onClick` handler to look like this (you'll also need to import `lodash` at the top of the file):

```jsx
var _ = require('lodash');

...
  onClick: function() {
    function createTweet(params) {
      lore.actions.tweet.create(_.extend(params, {
        userId: 1,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
      }))
    }

    ...
  },
...
```

Now when you submit a tweet, the action will send the data to the API, and your tweet will show up at the bottom of
the list. Try it out!

### What's up with the _.extend call?

Under normal circumstances our action call would only look like this (with no call to `_.extend(...)`):

```js
function createTweet(params) {
  lore.actions.tweet.create(params)
}
```

But because we're currently using a mock API through `json-server` some fields that would normally be created the API
won't exist on the data, and this can break our application code. So for now, we're simply going to create those
server-generated properties on the client-side when we create the data. We'll switch to a real API later in the
quickstart.

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this.

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

        borderRadius: '100px',
        outline: 'none'
      }
    }
  },

  onClick: function() {
    function createTweet(params) {
      lore.actions.tweet.create(params);
    }

    lore.dialog.show(function() {
      return lore.dialogs.tweet.create({
        onSubmit: createTweet
      });
    })
  },

  render: function () {
    var styles = this.getStyles();

    return (
      <button
        type="button"
        className="btn btn-primary btn-lg"
        style={styles.createButton}
        onClick={this.onClick}>
        +
      </button>
    );
  }
});

Next we're going to [create a way to edit tweets](../step-5/).
