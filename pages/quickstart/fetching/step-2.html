# Step 2: Create a Tweet Model

In this step we're going to create a model for our tweet, and learn about the implicit functionality provided by Lore.


### Create a Tweet Model
Before you can fetch data in Lore, you first need to create a model that represents the resource you want to fetch.
Since we want to fetch tweets, we are going to create a `tweet` model by running this command:

```
lore generate model tweet
```

This will create a `tweet` model and place the file at `src/models/tweet.js`. Open this file and you will see comments
showing you some of the properties you can override along with their default values. But if you ignore all the
comments this file is essentially empty:

```js
module.exports = {

};
```

### Console Demo: Convention-over-Configuration
As you'll soon see, we now have all the code required to fetch tweets from the API. Lore accomplishes this using
a philosophy called convention-over-configuration. With this approach the framework makes some assumptions about
what you want, and then provides you with the ability to override those assumptions if you need to.

To illustrate, refresh the browser and open up the developer console. Then enter this command into the console:

```js
lore.actions.tweet.find()
```

When you created the `tweet` model Lore assumed you wanted a set of actions that could find, create, update and
delete tweets. After creating these actions, it attached them to `lore.actions`. The command you just entered invoked
the `find` action to fetch tweets from the API. And if you examine the network tab, you can see that a network request
was indeed sent out to `http://localhost:1337/tweets`.

> The URL was composed from a convention, which defaults to "pluralize the model name and append it to the apiRoot". You
> can change this convention as needed through settings for pluralization, casing style, or just explicitly specifying
> the endpoint.

You can also fetch tweets by a specific user, by providing an object of query parameters to find() like this:

```js
lore.actions.tweet.find({
  userId: 1
})
```

In addition to create a set of actions, Lore also produces a set of reducers that store the tweets returned by the API.
To see the list of tweets returned for example, enter this command into the developer console:

```js
lore.store.getState().tweet.byId
```

That's pretty impressive, but we're not done yet. In the next section we'll learn how components can declare what data
they need.


### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this. Still the same as before :)

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

### src/models/tweet.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "Diff", "id": 1} | tab2={"name": "Source", "id": 2} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
![New Lore App](/assets/images/quickstart/diffs/fetching/step-2-tweet-model.png)
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```js
module.exports = {

};
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [connect our Feed to real data](../step-3/).
