# Step 2: Create Tweet Model

In this step we're going to create a model for our tweet, and learn about the implicit functionality provided by Lore.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore tutorial step9
```

### Create the Tweet Model
To create our tweet model run the following command:

```
lore generate model tweet
```

This command will create a model called `tweet` located at `src/models/tweet.js`. And if you open that file up, you
should see a lot of comments, which show some of the options that exist to tailor behavior when interacting with the
`/tweets` endpoint. But aside from the comments, this file is essentially empty:

```js
module.exports = {

};
```

### Empty File, Lots of Functionality
This file may be empty, but believe it or not, the application now has the ability to fetch, create, update and
delete tweets. To prove this, refresh your browser and open up the developer tools. Navigate to the console and enter
this command:

```
lore.actions.tweet.find()
```

Once you do this you should see a GET request sent to `http://localhost:1337/tweets`, and the API server will respond
with the first page of tweets. So basically, just by creating a model named `tweet`, you have a method you can invoke
to fetch tweets. That's pretty cool!

> When you do this you will see an error in the console like `Expected models to be an array but got...did you forget
> to override parse to extract the models?`. This is expected, and we'll be solving the issue in a couple steps.

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this. Still the same as before :)

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

### src/models/tweet.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "Diff", "id": 1} | tab2={"name": "Source", "id": 2} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```js

{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [connect our Feed to real data](../step-3/).
