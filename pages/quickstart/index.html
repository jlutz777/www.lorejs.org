# Introduction
This quickstart is intended to provide a quick introduction to Lore, to give you a sense of what the framework
feels like and whether it's something you want to invest more time in. As such, it will not spend time explaining
the concepts or reasoning behind the opinions the framework has. If you want a more thorough introduction (or
prefer a video introduction over text) please see the [tutorial](/tutorial/).

### What You'll Build
This is the application we'll be building. It is a Twitter-like app, pre-popuated with characters and quotes from
[Chrono Trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger).
