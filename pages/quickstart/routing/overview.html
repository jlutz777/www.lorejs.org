# Routing: Overview

In this section we'll learn about routing, and modify our application to change the content displayed as the URL
changes.

At the end of this section your application will look like this:

### React Router & Routes.js

At the root of your project is a file called `routes.js` that looks like this:

```jsx
var Master = require('./src/components/Master');
var Layout = require('./src/components/Layout');

module.exports = (
  <Route component={Master}>
    <Route path="/" component={Layout} />
  </Route>
);
```

If you're familiar with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) this file should look very
familiar. React Router is one of the core libraries that Lore is built on, and this file exposes the routes that are
passed to `react-router`.

> Lore makes no modifications to these routes or to the behavior of React Router, so if you have any questions about
> the syntax, or specific routing-related needs, all of React Router's
> [documentation](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/docs) and
> [examples](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/examples) will be directly applicable to Lore.
