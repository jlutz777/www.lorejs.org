# Step 2: Create the Application

To create a new application, type `lore new` into the command line followed the by name of your application. For this
example we are going to call our application `lore-quickstart`.

```sh
$ lore new lore-quickstart
```

This will create a new directory called `lore-quickstart`, and place all the application files inside. You should see
this message when the task completes.

```sh
  info:  Created a new Lore application `lore-quickstart`
```

### Optional: Create an ES6 and ESNext version of the app

Lore currently defaults to creating a project using ES5 syntax. If you'd prefer to use ES6, you can change the default
by passing in an optional command line argument:

```sh
$ lore new lore-quickstart --es6
```

If you'd prefer to use cutting-room floor features in ESNext (such as decorators and static property types), you can
generate a project using that syntax by passing in `--esnext` like this:

```sh
$ lore new lore-quickstart --esnext
```

In addition to changing the syntax of the initial project files, passing in either of these options will also set the
`language` property in the `.lorerc` file (located at the root of the project) to your preference.

This property serves as a way to declare your language preference to the CLI. Any files you generate for this project
from this point on will be created using that preference.

### Install Dependencies

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd lore-quickstart
$ npm install
```

Depending on your network connection, it may take 2-4 minutes for this step to complete.

## Next Steps

Now that we've created our project and installed the dependencies, let's [build the application](../step-3/).
