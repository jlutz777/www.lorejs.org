# Step 3: Run the Application
Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can run the application by typing `npm start`.

```sh
$ npm start
```

A successful execution should produce output similar to this:

```sh
  [431] ./~/lore-hook-reducers/lib/blueprints/byId.js 1.33 kB {0} [built]
  [432] ./~/lore-hook-reducers/lib/blueprints/byCid.js 2.48 kB {0} [built]
  [433] ./~/lore-hook-redux/lib/index.js 676 bytes {0} [built]
  [434] ./~/redux-thunk/lib/index.js 529 bytes {0} [built]
  [435] ./~/lore-hook-redux/lib/generateStore.js 497 bytes {0} [built]

webpack: bundle is now VALID.
```

This step invokes [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) build the application and starts up a development server so
you can view it in the browser.

### View the App

Once the application is done building, you can view it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. Once you do, you
should see this:

<img class="drop-shadow" src="/assets/images/quickstart/setup/step-3.png">

### Optional: Change the Port

If you want to change the port the server runs on, you can do that by using an alternate syntax to start the server.
If you examine the `package.json` file you'll see that `npm start` is just an alias for `node server`, and you can
pass a `port` argument to `node server` like this:

``` sh
node server --port=3001
```

> **NOTE**: If you generated the project using ES6 or ESNext syntax, then you'll need to start the server using
> `babel-node` like this:
>
> ``` sh
> ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node server --port=3001
> ```

### Note
If you are using Chrome and you see this error in the network requests you can safely ignore it.

```sh
GET http://localhost:3000/service-worker.js net::ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE
```

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [setup the mock API server](../step-4/) we'll be using for this quickstart.
