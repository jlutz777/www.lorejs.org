# Disabling Optimistic Behavior
TODO: fill this out. Answer is to override the action template or completely replace the action.

As the CLI evolves, it will include the ability to write your own plugins for it, so you can extend it to suit the
specific needs of your project. To learn more about the CLI and adding your own generators check out the CLI Docs.

### Code
How it's done.

```jsx
// actions/color/create.js

return {
  blueprint: 'create',

  model: lore.models.color,

  // comment out or remove this 'optimistic' section to disable
  // optimistic behavior
  optimistic: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.ADD_COLOR,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.CREATING
  },

  onSuccess: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.UPDATE_COLOR,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.RESOLVED
  },

  onError: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.REMOVE_COLOR,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING,
    beforeDispatch: function(response, args){
      // no op
    }
  }
};
```
