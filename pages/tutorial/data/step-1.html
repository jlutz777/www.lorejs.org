# Step 1: Add Mock Data to Feed

In this step we'll be adding some mock data to our feed. The practice of using fake data to populate components
while you're building out your application is fairly common, and can be quite helpful for support rapid
development. Sometimes it will also be necessary, as the API to support your application may not exist when you
start building it.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh

```

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

  </div>
</div>

## Written Steps

### Declare Tweets as a Prop
First, open your `Feed` component and declare that it is going to require `tweets` as a `prop`:

```jsx
...
  propTypes: {
    tweets: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },
...
```
And for ES6 you can find the line:
```jsx
Feed.propTypes = {};
```
and replace it with:

```jsx
Feed.propTypes ={
    tweets: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  };
```
As a quick refresher (or if you opted to skip learning more about Lore's data structure for now) _all_ data in Lore
is an object, even collections of tweets. We'll see why shortly.

### Create Mock Tweets
Next we're going to insert our mock data using `getDefaultProps`. This is a great method to use for mock data, as it
will be used to populate `tweets` if it wasn't passed in. So if you use this method for you mock data, it will
automatically be overwritten once real data starts being passed in. Pretty handy!

Add a `getDefaultProps` method to your `Feed` component and populate it with mock data like this for ES5:

```jsx
...
  getDefaultProps: function() {
    var tweet = {
      id: 1,
      cid: 'c1',
      state: 'RESOLVED',
      data: {
        id: 1,
        user: 1,
        text: 'Nothing can beat science!',
        createdAt: '2016-10-04T05:10:49.382Z'
      }
    };

    return {
      tweets: {
        state: 'RESOLVED',
        data: [tweet]
      }
    }
  },
...
```

For ES6 if you declare `getDefaultProps` inside the class, you'll get the following warning:

> warning.js:36 Warning: getDefaultProps was defined on Feed, a plain JavaScript class. 
  This is only supported for classes created using React.createClass. Use a static property to define defaultProps instead.

So instead of using the method above you can add the static property outside the class 
(you can put it below `Feed.propTypes = {...};` like this:

```jsx
Feed.defaultProps = (function() {
    var tweet = {
      id: 1,
      cid: 'c1',
      state: 'RESOLVED',
      data: {
        id: 1,
        user: 1,
        text: 'Nothing can beat science!',
        createdAt: '2016-10-04T05:10:49.382Z'
      }
    };

    return {
      tweets: {
        state: 'RESOLVED',
        data: [tweet]
      }
    }
  }());
```
In the function above, we're declaring a single tweet, with the text _"Nothing can beat science!"_ and adding it to an
array of tweets. In both cases the state has been set to `RESOLVED` to signify that nothing is happening to the data.

Now admittedly, when I'm mocking out the data in applications for real, I don't add all of these fields - only the ones
I'll actually need to mock out the component. For this example, the following data set is perfectly sufficient (and
I've collapsed it all into one data structure):

```jsx
...
  getDefaultProps: function() {
    return {
      tweets: {
        data: [{
          id: 1,
          data: {
            user: 1,
            text: 'Nothing can beat science!',
            createdAt: '2016-10-04T05:10:49.382Z'
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  },
...
```

### Render the Tweets
With some mock data created, let's pull it into our render method and display it on screen! To do that, we're going to
create a method called `renderTweet` that will contain the code to render each tweet. Then we'll iterate through
our mock tweets and map them into HTML to display on screen.

Add the following code to your `Feed` component.

```jsx
...
  renderTweet: function(tweet) {
    return (
      <li key={tweet.id}>
        {tweet.data.text}
      </li>
    );
  },

  render: function () {
    var styles = this.getStyles();
    var tweets = this.props.tweets;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2 style={styles.title}>
          Feed
        </h2>
        <ul className="media-list" style={styles.tweets}>
          {tweets.data.map(this.renderTweet)}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
...
```

With this code in place, you should now see the text of your mock tweet displayed to the screen. Awesome!

As a reminder, anytime you render a list of items in React, you need to add a `key` property that contains a unique
id that no other item in that list will share. In this example, we're using the `id` of our tweet, which for most
situations is a perfect solution. The only time you won't be able to use the `id` is when you're dealing with
optimistic updates, a use case we'll address later in this tutorial. Optimistic updates involve displaying data to
the user before it actually exists on the server, which means it won't have an `id` assigned to it yet.

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this.
