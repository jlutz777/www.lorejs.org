# Introduction
This tutorial *assumes you are relatively new to React* and is intended to highlight Loreâ€™s ability
to simplify application development by allowing you to focus on creating your components and not building
infrastructure (like actions and reducers) for server communication and data storage.

As such, much of the tutorial is focused on React itself, with occasional project configuration included in order
to demonstrate Lore's ability to overcome development hurdles required to make the application function.

> If you have a suggestion for how to improve this tutorial
> [there has been an issue created](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues/101) expressly for that discussion.
> Love to hear your thoughts!
>
> In the future *there will also be a video of this tutorial* for easier consumption.

### What You'll Build
This is the application we'll be building, the "Guessatron 5000". You type in the name of a color and submit it,
and when you click on that color the route will change. The Guessatron will fetch that color, look at the name,
and then attempt to show you a swatch of what that color actually looks like (it's all fake, don't get too excited).

your application:

* Creating a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account
* Deploy the API server to Heroku
* Creating a [Surge](https://surge.sh/) account
* Publishing the UI to Surge

## Next Steps
