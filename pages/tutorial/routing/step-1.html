# Step 1: Routes & React Router

In this step we won't be modifying any code, but we will be learning about how to change what's displayed in your
application based on the route in the URL.

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

## Written Steps

### Routes.js

At the root of your project, you should see a file called `routes.js` that looks like this:

```jsx
var Master = require('./src/components/Master');
var Layout = require('./src/components/Layout');

module.exports = (
  <Route component={Master}>
    <Route path="/" component={Layout} />
  </Route>
);
```

This file describes how your application should look as the route in the URL changes. For example, in a typical
application, you'll often need to answer questions like these:

1. When the user lands at the root route, such as `https://app.example.com`, what should they see?
2. When the user clicks a link and navigates to `https://app.example.com/profile`, how do I replace the content on the
homepage with the profile page?
3. How do I pass URL parameters to components, such as the tweet id `123` in `https://app.exmaple.com/tweets/123`, so
the component knows which tweet to display?

These types of questions are _exactly_ what this file is used for. But providing a solution for routing concerns like
those listed above has it's own challenges, and to solve those challenges Lore relies on [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router),
one of the core libraries the framework is built on.

### React Router

The syntax you see in the `routes.js` file is not something custom to Lore; it is a direct exposure of what
`react-router` expects, so if you have any questions about the syntax, or specific routing-related needs, all of
react-router's [documentation](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/docs) and
[examples](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/examples) will be directly applicable to Lore. At
the time of this writing, new Lore projects are configured to use v2 of the react-router, with v4 having just been
released (v3 was never released and was skipped over).

### What does the structure mean?

If you look at the contents of `routes.js` currently, you can see there is a root route that contains the `Master`
component with a child route containing the `Layout` component. You can think of this as the `Master` component
wrapping the `Layout` component, which is essentially what happens. Because of that, you can apply standard React reasoning
to the routes to understand their relationship and behavior. If the `Master` component rerenders, the Layout component
will also rerender, and we'll be relying on that behavior later as we start fetching data from our example server.

## Next Steps

Next we're going to convert our application title in our header [to a react-router link](../step-2/).
