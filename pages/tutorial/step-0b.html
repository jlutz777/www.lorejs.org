# Creating A New Project

To create a new Lore app, type `lore new` into the command line followed the name of your application. For this example
we are going to call our application `lore-tutorial`.

### Create a new app

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial
```

This will create a new directory called `lore-tutorial`, and place all the necessary files inside. You should see 
this message when the task completes.

```sh
  info:  Created a new Lore application `lore-tutorial`
```

### Optional: Create an ES6 version of the app

Lore currently defaults to creating a project using ES5 syntax. If you'd prefer to use ES6, you can change the default
by passing in an optional command line argument:

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial --es6
```

This will make it so that all files in the project are generated using ES6 syntax, and also adds a setting in the `.lorerc`
file that will cause all the generators to create their files in ES6 as well. In an upcoming release, Lore will also add an 
option for using ESNext syntax.

### Install Dependencies

Once the project is created, navigate into the directory and install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd lore-tutorial
$ npm install
```

### Start the application

Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can start the app by running `npm start`.

```sh
$ npm start
```

This step kicks off Webpack and builds the project.  A successful execution should produce output similar to this:

```sh
  [420] ./~/lore/lib/Hook.js 286 bytes {0} [built]
  [421] ./~/lore/lib/app/getInitializers.js 217 bytes {0} [built]
  [422] ./~/lore/lib/app/sortHooksByLoadOrder.js 878 bytes {0} [built]
  [423] ./~/lore/~/topsort/lib/topsort.js 3.17 kB {0} [built]
  [424] ./~/lore/lib/app/getConfig.js 469 bytes {0} [built]

webpack: bundle is now VALID.
```

### View the App

At this point the application is built, and you can view it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your 
browser.  You should see this:

### Changing the Port

If you want to change the port the server runs on, you can do that by using an alternate syntax to start the server.
`npm start` is just an alias for `node server`, and you can pass a `port` argument to `node server` like so:

``` sh
node server --port=3001
```

If you're using ES6 for the project, you'll need to start the server using `babel-node` like this:

``` sh
./node_modules/.bin/babel-node server --port=3001
```

### Note
If you are using Chrome and you see this error in the network requests you can safely ignore it.

```sh
GET http://localhost:3000/service-worker.js net::ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE
```

## Next Steps

Next we're going to do some [quick orientation](../step-0c/) and then dive into making the project.
