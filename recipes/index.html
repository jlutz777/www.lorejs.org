  <h1>What are Recipes?</h1>
  <p>
    Lore is a fairly opinionated framework, but those opinions are constrained by an ability to make safe assumptions
    about what applications are going to need and how API servers will behave and evolve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some aspects of UI development, while common concerns across many applications (such as user authentication)
    vary immensely in terms of how they need to be implemented, sometimes expressing extremely nuanced behaviors and
    needs. In these situations it stops being possible to make reasonable assumptions about HOW to integrate support
    for those features, and the best the framework can do it discuss patterns that work well, and provide help for
    integrating and adapting those patterns to meet the specific needs of your application.
  </p>

  <p>
    That section will be covering topics that fall into that category. Some examples of topics that will be covered
    include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>User Authentication</li>
    <li>Adding Stylesheets</li>
    <li>Patterns for Dialogs and Wizards</li>
    <li>Loading Screens</li>
    <li>Disabling Optimistic Behavior</li>
    <li>Error Handling</li>
  </ul>
