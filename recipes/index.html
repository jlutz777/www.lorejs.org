  <h1>What are Recipes?</h1>
  <p>
    Lore is a fairly opinionated framework, but those opinions are constrained by an ability to make safe assumptions
    about what applications are going to need and how API servers will behave and evolve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some aspects of UI development, while being a common requirement for many applications (such as user authentication),
    often vary significantly in terms of how they need to be implemented. In these situations it stops being possible
    to make reasonable assumptions about HOW to integrate support for them, and the best the framework can do is
    discuss patterns that work well, and provide help for integrating and adapting those patterns to meet the specific
    demands of your application.

  <p>
    That section will be covering topics that fall into that category. Some examples of topics that will be covered
    include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>User Authentication</li>
    <li>Adding Stylesheets</li>
    <li>Patterns for Dialogs and Wizards</li>
    <li>Loading Screens</li>
    <li>Disabling Optimistic Behavior</li>
    <li>Error Handling</li>
  </ul>
